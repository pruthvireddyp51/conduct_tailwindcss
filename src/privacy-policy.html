        <h2 class="py-4 text-gray-800">4. HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
        <p class="pb-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as it is lawful and necessary
          to do so. This is so that we can provide the services, products or information you have requested, administer
          your relationship with us, ensure we don’t communicate with you if you’ve asked us not to and comply with the
          law. We will review and assess our approach to data protection every two years.</p>

        <h2 class="py-4 text-gray-800">5. HOW WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE</h2>
        <p class="pb-3 text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">We have physical, technical and human controls in place to keep your information secure. We
          ensure that extra controls are in place for financial, sensitive and special categories of information,
          meeting regulatory and legal requirements for managing these types of information. The transmission of
          information over the internet is never completely secure and Conduct cannot guarantee the security of any
          information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. We advise against sending personal information
          using unsecure Wi-Fi (e.g. free public Wi-Fi). Once we receive your data, we make every effort to ensure its
          security both on our systems and while in transit between our systems and any partners working on our behalf.
          Access to your personal information is restricted to those who require it to do our work and all staff with
          access to your personal data are trained in how to keep it safe. We cannot be responsible for the privacy
          policies and practices of other websites, even if you access them using links from our websites and we
          recommend that you check the policy of each site you visit.
